# SexLab P+ Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **SexLab Patch Plus (SLP+)** and related tools.

---

## What is SexLab P+?

**SexLab P+** (Patch Plus) is a complete overhaul of the SexLab Framework for Skyrim Special Edition. It rewrites the original framework from the ground up to deliver dramatically better performance, unlimited animation support, and modern features that were previously only available through multiple addon mods.

If you're familiar with the original SexLab Framework, P+ is a drop-in replacement that makes everything faster, removes frustrating limitations, and consolidates features from popular addons like SLSO, SLAS, and more into a single package.

### Why Choose SexLab P+?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Instant Performance** | Animation registration that took minutes now happens near-instantly at startup |
| **Unlimited Animations** | No more 1000-animation cap—install as many packs as you want |
| **Set It and Forget It** | MCM settings save to `Settings.yaml` and persist across all saves automatically |
| **All-in-One** | Built-in features replace SLSO, SLAS, SLGP, and other addon mods |
| **Modern Foundation** | Uses SLSB instead of SLAL for faster, more reliable animation loading |
